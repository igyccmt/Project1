# ProjectGivenInClass
This is rather a repository for me to get involved in Github and SourceControl.
I'll be doing a project given to me in school again,
and I plan on finishing it by the time semester starts.

Edit(12.09.2023): I have finished the project for once this morning, and I got the score 0.74454 in auc. I have been working for almost more than a week now, and I have encountered a lot of problems which I had not in the first time solving this problem with my teammate Hakan Åženyurt. This time all the responsibility was on me as I was alone, but i managed to pull through it. I am happy and proud and eager to learn more.
